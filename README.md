# SEIF-React-Revision
A list of projects I created for the SEIF-8 course which I did as a form of revision for the React Unit. Do take note that these are my solutions and they are by no means the best way of approaching the problem. There are many different ways of solving the problems, and this is just one of the ways and what I learned by tackling the problems.

### Week 1
Concepts learned:
- Create-React-App
- Components
- JSX
